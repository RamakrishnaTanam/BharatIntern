Title: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

Project Description:

Stock Price Prediction using LSTM is a data science project that aims to forecast the future stock prices of a company based on historical data. This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction problems like stock price forecasting. LSTM networks are capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them effective for predicting stock prices, which exhibit complex and non-linear patterns over time.

1. Introduction
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of LSTM networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. It provides a basic framework that can be extended and customized for specific stock analysis needs.

Project Features
Utilizes LSTM networks for accurate stock price prediction.
Provides a Jupyter Notebook interface for interactive development and visualization.
Allows users to experiment with different time steps and LSTM architecture configurations.
Offers a starting point for more advanced stock market prediction models and strategies.
2. Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd Stock-Price-Prediction-LSTM
Install the required libraries:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
Prepare your historical stock price data in CSV format and update the your_data.csv file with the relevant information.

3. Project Structure
File Descriptions
StockPricePrediction_LSTM.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the LSTM model implementation and visualization code.
your_data.csv: Sample CSV file containing historical stock price data (replace with your dataset).
Directory Structure
/images: Directory to store images and plots generated by the code.
4. Usage
Running the Code
Open StockPricePrediction_LSTM.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.
Modify parameters, such as time_steps and LSTM architecture, for experimentation.
Modifying Parameters
time_steps: Number of previous data points used for predicting the next stock price.
LSTM architecture parameters (units, layers) can be adjusted in the model creation section for optimization.
5. Results
Example Output
The predicted stock price based on the provided dataset and LSTM configuration will be displayed in the notebook's output cell.
Performance Metrics
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
